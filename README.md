Vision
Virtara’s mission is to empower athletes of all levels—recreational lifters, competitive athletes, and coaches—by providing highly technical, unbiased feedback based on biomechanics and exercise science. The platform will also serve as a tool for meet verification and community collaboration, fostering innovation and inclusivity in the lifting and sports science communities.

Core Features
1. Pose Analysis
Technology: MediaPipe (initial), TensorFlow (custom models), Google Gemini AI.
Metrics Tracked:
Bar path trajectory.
Joint angles (e.g., knees, hips, shoulders).
Velocity and acceleration.
Symmetry and balance.
Range of motion (ROM).
Power Output:
Estimate power based on barbell weight, velocity, and acceleration.
Example: "Your power output during the deadlift was 800 watts, which is optimal for your weight class."
Control:
Analyze movement stability and control during lifts (e.g., barbell wobble, joint stability).
Example: "Your barbell control during the bench press improved by 15% compared to last month."
Time Under Tension (TUT):
Measure the duration of muscle engagement during lifts.
Example: "Your squat descent lasted 3.2 seconds, which is ideal for hypertrophy training."
Rep in Reserve (RIR):
Calculate RIR to estimate how many reps the user could perform before failure.
Formula:
RIR can be estimated using bar velocity and power output:
RIR
=
Max Velocity
−
Current Velocity
Max Velocity
×
Fatigue Coefficient
RIR= 
Max Velocity×Fatigue Coefficient
Max Velocity−Current Velocity
​
 
The Fatigue Coefficient is determined based on the lift type and user input (e.g., perceived exertion).
Example: "Your RIR for this set is 2, indicating you could perform 2 more reps before failure."
2. Progress Tracking
Metrics:
Historical trends for bar path, joint angles, lift velocity, and PRs.
Goal tracking (e.g., "Improve squat depth to 120 degrees hip flexion").
Injury risk monitoring (e.g., excessive knee valgus).
Power and Control:
Track improvements in power output and movement control over time.
Time Under Tension:
Monitor TUT trends for hypertrophy and strength training goals.
Rep in Reserve (RIR):
Track RIR trends to monitor training intensity and fatigue management.
Visualizations:
Graphs and charts for progress tracking.
Phase comparisons (e.g., setup, descent, ascent).
Features:
PR tracking and notifications.
Comparative analysis (e.g., current vs. past performance).
3. Real-Time Analysis
Use Cases:
Instant feedback during training sessions.
VAR-style verification for powerlifting meets.
Features:
Real-time pose detection and metric calculation.
Visual overlays (e.g., bar path trajectory, joint angle markers).
Feedback generation using custom LLM and Google Gemini AI.
RIR Calculation:
Provide real-time RIR estimates during sets to help users manage fatigue and intensity.
Technology:
MediaPipe for pose detection.
TensorFlow for advanced metric calculations.
Socket.io for real-time communication.
4. Community and Coaching Features
Athlete-Coach Interaction:
Direct messaging for feedback and guidance.
Lift reviews with text and visual overlays.
Community Features:
Progress sharing (e.g., lift videos, PRs).
Discussion forums and leaderboards.
Community challenges (e.g., "Best squat depth this month").
Coaching Tools:
Athlete management dashboard.
Progress reports and goal tracking.
Lift analysis tools.
5. Meet Verification
Use Cases:
Real-time lift verification for powerlifting meets.
VAR-style analysis for judges and sponsors.
Features:
Live monitoring of bar path, joint angles, and symmetry.
Decision logging (approve/reject lifts).
Technology:
Socket.io for real-time communication.
Google Gemini AI for advanced reasoning.
6. Dedicated Camera (Future Development)
Features:
Built-in pose analysis and bar path tracking.
Real-time feedback and visual overlays.
Cloud integration with the Virtara platform.
Hardware:
AI chip (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson Nano, Google Coral).
High-resolution camera sensor (1080p or 4K).
Use Cases:
Training sessions and meet verification.
Custom LLM Architecture
Purpose
The custom LLM will act as the reasoning engine for Virtara, providing:

Highly technical feedback based on pose data and biomechanical principles.
Adaptable insights tailored to user goals (e.g., strength, technique improvement, injury prevention).
Actionable explanations for improving lift performance.
Architecture
1. Input Data
Pose Data:
Joint coordinates, bar path trajectories, velocity, acceleration, etc.
Extracted using MediaPipe or TensorFlow.
User Context:
Goals (e.g., strength, injury prevention).
Skill level (e.g., beginner, intermediate, advanced).
Biomechanical Knowledge:
Predefined rules and principles (e.g., "Optimal hip angle during squat descent is 90–120 degrees").
2. Model Type
Base Model:
Start with a pre-trained LLM (e.g., GPT-3 or Google Gemini AI).
Custom Fine-Tuning:
Fine-tune the base model using annotated datasets (pose data + biomechanical insights).
Use TensorFlow or Hugging Face Transformers for fine-tuning.
3. Multimodal Inputs
Combine pose data (numerical) with textual data (biomechanical principles).
Use a multimodal architecture like Vision-Language Models (e.g., CLIP or Flamingo) to process both types of inputs.
4. Output
Text-Based Feedback:
Example: "Your knee flexion during the squat descent is 45 degrees, which reduces quadriceps activation. Aim for 90–120 degrees to maximize strength."
Visual Overlays:
Example: Bar path trajectory and joint angle markers displayed on the video feed.
Training Workflow
1. Data Collection
Annotate pose data with biomechanical insights and coaching cues.
Expand the dataset with powerlifting meet videos and community submissions.
2. Model Training
Use TensorFlow to train the LLM.
Fine-tune the model using annotated datasets.
3. Validation
Test the LLM on unseen data to evaluate accuracy and generalization.
Gather feedback from users to refine the model.
