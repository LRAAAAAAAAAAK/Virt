## Core Features

1. Pose Analysis
Technology: MediaPipe (initial), TensorFlow (custom models), Google Gemini AI.

1.1 Bar Path Trajectory:
- Definition: The path the barbell travels during a lift, measured in 2D or 3D space.
Calculation:
- Extract the barbell’s position frame-by-frame using pose detection (e.g., MediaPipe or TensorFlow).
- Plot the positions over time to visualize the trajectory.
    - Deviation:
        -  Calculate the deviation from the optimal path using: 
        - Root Mean Square Calculation

1.2 Joint Angles:
- Definition: The angles formed at key joints (e.g., knees, hips, shoulders) during different phases of the lift.
- Calculation:
    - Use pose detection to extract joint coordinates (e.g., hip, knee, ankle).
    - Calculate angles using the law of cosines:
        - Angle=arccos(a2 + b2 + c2 / ab2) 
        - Where a,b,c are the lengths of the sides of the triangle formed by the joint coordinates.
    - Example: "Your knee angle during the squat descent is 110 degrees, which is optimal for glute activation."

1.3 Velocity 
- Definition: The speed and rate of change of speed of the barbell during the lift.
- Calculation
    - Velocity = Displacement (Δs) / Time (Δt) 
- Example: "Your barbell velocity during the concentric phase is 0.8 m/s."

1.4 Acceleration
- Definition: The speed and rate of change of speed of the barbell during the lift.
- Calculation
    - Acceleration = final velocity - intitial velocity / time 
- Example: "Your barbell acceleration during the pull phase is 1.2 m/s^2.

1.5 Symmetry and Balance
- Definition: The comparison of left and right side movements to identify imbalances.
- Calculation
    - Extract joint positions for both sides (e.g., left and right shoulders, hips, knees).
    - Calculate the difference in movement patterns:
        - Symmetry = Left Side Metric - Right Side Metric / Average Metric * 1000
        - Example: "Your left-right symmetry is 95%, indicating excellent balance."

1.6 Range of Motion (ROM) 
- Definition: The total distance a joint travels during a lift.
    - Calculation 
        - Measure the maximum and minimum positions of the joint during the lift.
        - ROM = Max Position - Min Position 
        - Example: "Your hip ROM during the squat is 40 cm, which is ideal for depth."

1.7 Power Output
- Definition: The rate at which work is done during the lift.
- Calculation
    - Power = Force * Velocity / Time
    - Force 
        - Force = Mass * Acceleration
        - Where mass is the weight of the barbell.
    - Example: "Your power output during the deadlift is 800 watts, which is optimal for your weight class."

1.8 Control 
- Definition: The stability of the barbell and joints during the lift.
- Calculation
    - Measure deviations in barbell position and joint angles over time.
    - Calculate the standard deviation of the barbell’s trajectory:
        - Control = 1 - Standard Deviation of Bar
        - Example: "Your barbell control during the bench press improved by 15% compared to last month."

1.9 Time Under Tension (TUT)
- Definition: The total time muscles are engaged during a lift.
- Calculation
    - Measure the duration of the eccentric and concentric phases of the lift:
    - TUT = TIMEeccentric + TIMEconcentric
    - Example: "Your squat descent lasted 3.2 seconds, which is ideal for hypertrophy training."

1.10 Rep in Reserve (RIR)
- Definition: The estimated number of reps a user could perform before failure.
- Calculation  
    - RIR = Max Velcoity - Current Velocity / Max Velocity * Fatigue Coefficient

2. Progress Tracking
- Track historical trends for bar path, joint angles, lift velocity, power output, control, TUT, and RIR.
- Visualize progress with graphs and charts.
- Enable goal setting and tracking (e.g., "Improve squat depth to 120 degrees hip flexion").
- Provide injury risk monitoring (e.g., excessive knee valgus).

3. Real-Time Analysis
- Provide instant feedback during training sessions using pose analysis and AI reasoning.
- Display visual overlays (e.g., bar path trajectory, joint angle markers) on video feeds.
- Enable VAR-style verification for powerlifting meets.

4. Calorie Counter
