Virtara is built to empower users by offering highly technical feedback, progress tracking, real-time analysis, and nutrition tracking—all in one place, under one price. Whether you’re a recreational lifter, a competitive athlete, or a coach, Virtara provides the tools you need to optimize your performance and nutrition.

Features
1. Pose Analysis
Technology: MediaPipe (initial), TensorFlow (custom models), Google Gemini AI.
Metrics Tracked:
Bar path trajectory.
Joint angles (e.g., knees, hips, shoulders).
Velocity and acceleration.
Symmetry and balance.
Range of motion (ROM).
Power Output:
Estimate power based on barbell weight, velocity, and acceleration.
Example: "Your power output during the deadlift was 800 watts, which is optimal for your weight class."
Control:
Analyze movement stability and control during lifts (e.g., barbell wobble, joint stability).
Example: "Your barbell control during the bench press improved by 15% compared to last month."
Time Under Tension (TUT):
Measure the duration of muscle engagement during lifts.
Example: "Your squat descent lasted 3.2 seconds, which is ideal for hypertrophy training."
Rep in Reserve (RIR):
Calculate RIR to estimate how many reps the user could perform before failure.
Formula:
RIR
=
Max Velocity
−
Current Velocity
Max Velocity
×
Fatigue Coefficient
RIR= 
Max Velocity×Fatigue Coefficient
Max Velocity−Current Velocity
​
 
Example: "Your RIR for this set is 2, indicating you could perform 2 more reps before failure."

Custom LLM Architecture
Purpose
The custom LLM will act as the reasoning engine for Virtara, providing:

Highly technical feedback based on pose data and biomechanical principles.
Adaptable insights tailored to user goals (e.g., strength, technique improvement, injury prevention).
Actionable explanations for improving lift performance.
Architecture
1. Input Data
Pose Data:
Joint coordinates, bar path trajectories, velocity, acceleration, etc.
Extracted using MediaPipe or TensorFlow.
User Context:
Goals (e.g., strength, injury prevention).
Skill level (e.g., beginner, intermediate, advanced).
Biomechanical Knowledge:
Predefined rules and principles (e.g., "Optimal hip angle during squat descent is 90–120 degrees").
2. Model Type
Base Model:
Start with a pre-trained LLM (e.g., GPT-3 or Google Gemini AI).
Custom Fine-Tuning:
Fine-tune the base model using annotated datasets (pose data + biomechanical insights).
Use TensorFlow or Hugging Face Transformers for fine-tuning.
3. Multimodal Inputs
Combine pose data (numerical) with textual data (biomechanical principles).
Use a multimodal architecture like Vision-Language Models (e.g., CLIP or Flamingo) to process both types of inputs.
4. Output
Text-Based Feedback:
Example: "Your knee flexion during the squat descent is 45 degrees, which reduces quadriceps activation. Aim for 90–120 degrees to maximize strength."
Visual Overlays:
Example: Bar path trajectory and joint angle markers displayed on the video feed.
