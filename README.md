Features
1. 1. Pose Analysis
Technology: MediaPipe (initial), TensorFlow (custom models), Google Gemini AI.

Metrics Tracked and Calculations:
1. Bar Path Trajectory:
Definition: The path the barbell travels during a lift, measured in 2D or 3D space.
Calculation:
Extract the barbell’s position frame-by-frame using pose detection (e.g., MediaPipe or TensorFlow).
Plot the positions over time to visualize the trajectory.
Deviation:
Calculate the deviation from the optimal path using: [Calculation Here]

2. Joint Angles
Joint Angles:
Definition: The angles formed at key joints (e.g., knees, hips, shoulders) during different phases of the lift.
Calculation:
Use pose detection to extract joint coordinates (e.g., hip, knee, ankle).
Calculate angles using the law of cosines: Angle = arcoss (a2 + b2 - c2 / 2ab)
Example: "Your knee angle during the squat descent is 110 degrees, which is optimal for glute activation."
Example: "Your bar path deviated by 3 cm during the pull phase."

3. Velocity and Acceleration:
Definition: The speed and rate of change of speed of the barbell during the lift.
Calculation:
Velocity: [Calculation Here]
Example: "Your barbell velocity during the concentric phase is 0.8 m/s."
Acceleration: [Calculation Here]
Example: "Your barbell acceleration during the pull phase is 1.2 m/s^2."

4. Symmetry and Balance:
Definition: The comparison of left and right side movements to identify imbalances.
Calculation:
Extract joint positions for both sides (e.g., left and right shoulders, hips, knees).
Symmetry Balance = Left Side Metric - Right Side Metric / Average Metric x 100
Example: "Your left-right symmetry is 95%, indicating excellent balance."

5. Definition: The total distance a joint travels during a lift.
Calculation: ROM= Max Position − Min Position
Measure the maximum and minimum positions of the joint during the lift.
Example: "Your hip ROM during the squat is 40 cm, which is ideal for depth."

6. Power Output
Definition: The rate at which work is done during the lift.
Calculation: Power = Force * Velocity / Time
             Force = Mass * Acceleration
             Where mass is the weight of the barbell.
Example: "Your power output during the deadlift is 800 watts, which is optimal for your weight class."

7. Definition: The stability of the barbell and joints during the lift.
Calculation:
    Measure deviations in barbell position and joint angles over time.
    Calculate the standard deviation of the barbell’s trajectory:
    Control = 1 - Standard Deviation of Bar Path
    Example: "Your barbell control during the bench press improved by 15% compared to last month."

8. Time Under Tension
    Definition: The total time muscles are engaged during a lift.
    Calculation:
        Measure the duration of the eccentric and concentric phases of the lift:
        Time Under Tension = TimeECCENTRIC + TimeCONCENTRIC
        Example: "Your squat descent lasted 3.2 seconds, which is ideal for hypertrophy training."

9. Rep in Reserve (RIR):
    Definition: The estimated number of reps a user could perform before failure.
    Calculation:
    Reps in Reserve = Max Velocity - Current Velocity / Max Velocity * Fatigue Coefficient
Example: "Your RIR for this set is 2, indicating you could perform 2 more reps before failure."


2. Progress Tracking
Metrics:
Historical trends for bar path, joint angles, lift velocity, and PRs.
Goal tracking (e.g., "Improve squat depth to 120 degrees hip flexion").
Injury risk monitoring (e.g., excessive knee valgus).
Power and Control:
Track improvements in power output and movement control over time.
Time Under Tension:
Monitor TUT trends for hypertrophy and strength training goals.
Rep in Reserve (RIR):
Track RIR trends to monitor training intensity and fatigue management.
Visualizations:
Graphs and charts for progress tracking.
Phase comparisons (e.g., setup, descent, ascent).
Features:
PR tracking and notifications.
Comparative analysis (e.g., current vs. past performance).
3. Real-Time Analysis
Use Cases:
Instant feedback during training sessions.
VAR-style verification for powerlifting meets.
Features:
Real-time pose detection and metric calculation.
Visual overlays (e.g., bar path trajectory, joint angle markers).
Feedback generation using custom LLM and Google Gemini AI.

Use AI to identify food items from pictures.
Note: Users manually input food weights for accuracy.
Manual Entry:
Add custom foods and nutritional data.

Example: "You’ve consumed 2,000 calories today, with 150g protein, 200g carbs, and 50g fats."
Integration:
Sync calorie and macro data with training metrics for holistic performance tracking.
Example: "Your calorie intake this week aligns with your hypertrophy training goals."
